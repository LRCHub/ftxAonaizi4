Well, the guys that I work with they work real hard
And they like to have a good time
And at the end of the day it's their time to play
And they like to go and unwind.

Well, they make a lot of jokes and they laugh and they poke fun at me
'Cause I don't stay long
And they can't understand why a married ma
Is in a hurry to ever go home.

Chorus:
Well, I just tell 'em that all the fun that I'm ever gonna need
I gotta waitin' at home for me
Yeah, she likes to dance and she loves romance
And she throws a great party
Naw there never any dull minutes around here
'Cause somethin' always a goin' on
All the fun that a man could want
I got waitin' for me at home.

Hey, I use to be a fool and a sucker for a high time
Anytime night or day
I had around the clock smile just call me
And I would love be a readily on my way.

But to tell you the truth I was lonesome and blue
Prayin' for a little light in my life
And then a miracle came and everything changed
And I made that little woman my wife.

Chorus:
Well, let me tell you that all the fun that I'm ever gonna need
I gotta waitin' at home for me
Yeah, she likes to dance and she loves romance
And she throws a great party
Naw there never any dull minutes around here
'Cause somethin' always a goin' on
All the fun that a man could want
I got waitin' for me at home.

We got two little kids callin' me daddy
Runnin' all over the house
And when they finally go to sleep
Their momma and me
Cuddle and we snuggle and we party on the couch.

Chorus:
Yeah, I got all the fun that a man could want
Waitin' at home for me
Yeah, she likes to dance and she loves romance
And she throws a great party
Naw there never any dull minutes around here
'Cause somethin' always a goin' on
All the fun that a man could want
I got waitin' for me at home.

I said now all the fun that a man could want
I got waitin' for me at home
Right at home
I got all the fun that a man could want
All the fun that a man could want
I got all the fun that a man could want
All the fun that a man could want...
